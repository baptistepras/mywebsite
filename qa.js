    question: "Who are you?",
    answer: "I’m Baptiste Pras, currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Université Paris-Saclay, and I am looking for a 3-4 months internship starting in May."
  },
  {
    question: "What did you do during your research internship?",
    answer: "I worked on Biomedical Entity Linking using Transformer-based and contrastive learning models and a unified benchmark to evaluate them. I then proposed different mention-level characteristics to offer insight into how to improve models by analysing where models consistently failed. This resulted in a paper submitted to an ACL venue."
  },
  {
    question: "What did you do during your TER?",
    answer: "I worked on class-imbalanced problems, trying to identify an optimal imbalance ratio in the training set different from 0.5. I conducted experiments in Python using NumPy and Scikit-Learn with a hand-coded Spherical Teacher-Student Perceptron, creating various scenarios of imbalance and using different loss functions or learning methods." 
  },
  {
    question: "What did you do at Outlier?",
    answer: "At Outlier, I worked remotely as an AI expert. I was in charge of designing and refining prompts to enhance the performance of generative AI models. I also reviewed, evaluated, and corrected AI-generated outputs to ensure accuracy and quality."
  },
  {
    question: "What did you do at Carrefour?",
    answer: "At Carrefour, I worked to stock shelves and assist clients in the store. I worked every summer since I was 18 (5 summers), usually working 2 months full-time (36.75 hours)."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your main skills?",
    answer: "I can code in Python, C++/C, OCaml, and Java. I can use Python libraries such as Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib, and apply these skills to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your educational background?",
    answer: "I studied Mathematics and Computer Science in a dual bachelor’s at Paris-Saclay before entering the Magistère d’Informatique program during my 3rd year of bachelor's. I am now pursuing a master's in Artificial Intelligence at Université Paris-Saclay."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your past experiences?",
    answer: "My experiences include a research internship at LISN Saclay, a TER (small research internship) also at LISN. I also worked remotely for a few months at Outlier, where I served as an AI expert, reviewing AI outputs to train them. Finally, I worked my last 5 summers at Carrefour as a student job."
  },
  {
    question: "What was your GPA?",
    answer: "My GPAs during my 2 years of dual bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science were: 14.67, 14.47. My GPA during my third year of bachelor's, in the Magistère d'Informatique program, was 15.06."
  },
  {
    question: "What languages do you speak?",
    answer: "I am a native French speaker and I am fluent in English (TOEFL 108/120). I also have some basics in Russian."
  },
  {
    question: "Where did you learn to speak English?",
    answer: "I became fluent in English during a year abroad in New-York when I was 16, where I focused exclusively on studying the language."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have any projects to show us?",
    answer: "Yes, throughout my internships and my classes, I realized many projects, such as an AI to play a game of Dual Sudoku in Java, a Teacher-Student Perceptron in Python, an image classification project to recognize traffic signs in Python, an Air Hockey game in Python, a Java-like Interpreter in OCaml, and many more... Here is the link to my GitHub page: https://github.com/baptistepras."
  },
  {
    question: "Tell me more about the AI for Dual Sudoku project",
    answer: "In groups of 2, we designed an AI agent to play a competitive version of Sudoku. We developed a custom combination of heuristic search and dynamic evaluation of game states, allowing the agent to adapt its strategy in real time based on both the current grid state and the opponent’s moves. The AI achieved excellent results and won the final competition of the course, outperforming all other agents submitted by the class."
  },
  {
    question: "Tell me more about the Teacher-Student Perceptron",
    answer: "As a part of my TER, I implemented a Teacher-Student Perceptron in Python, using NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and MatPlotLib. This helped create a controlled environment where I could experiment with various scenarios for my studies. It includes the creation of Gaussian data, assignment of the class, resampling of the training set, and training of the Perceptron model."
  },
  {
    question: "Tell me more about the image classification project",
    answer: "During my first year of bachelor's, I designed a model to detect various traffic signs in pictures, by extracting different chosen and hand-coded characteristics of the images. I handled data manipulation and model training, achieving an accuracy of over 0.95."
  },
  {
    question: "Tell me more about the Java-Like Interpreter",
    answer: "I developed a custom interpreter based on Java in OCaml, featuring support for various instructions, basic arithmetic operations, and object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and methods. Designed the language with a strong type system similar to Java’s, ensuring robust and reliable code execution. You can try this language directly on my website."
  },
  {
    question: "Tell me more about the Air Hockey game",
    answer: "In my last year of high school, we designed in a group of 4 an Air Hockey game, doing the graphics, the home page, coding the whole physics from scratch, and even implementing a rudimentary AI agent to play against."
  },
  {
    question: "What do you want to do in the future?",
    answer: "After completing my master's degree, I wish to pursue a PhD in either Machine Learning and Optimization or Natural Language Processing. I then wish to do research, either in the industry or as a researcher-professor in a university."
  },
  {
    question: "What fields do you want to work in?",
    answer: "I'm particularly interested in defense or energy, but I am also considering working in finance later."
  },
  {
    question: "Tell me more about yourself",
    answer: "Besides my passion for Artificial Intelligence, I play basketball, I enjoy hiking, and I participated in several algorithmic contests. I particularly enjoy solving algorithmic problems in graphs."
